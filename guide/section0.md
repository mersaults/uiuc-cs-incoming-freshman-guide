# Section 0: So I've Been Admitted. What Now?

## 0.1: Preparing for Your First Semester

Anybody that tells you that you need to academically prepare for college between your acceptance and your enrollment is obviously wrong. Celebrate your acceptance by getting a much needed break, and enjoy your final moments as a high school student by spending time with friends and family. Unless you're planning on taking a proficiency exam to place out of a class or you just really realy like academics (more power to you), you don't need to do anything to prepare yourself for the CS curriculum at UIUC. That said, if you think you're really rusty and want to practice coding before you start, [leetcode](leetcode.com) and [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) are both great resources to brush up on your programming skills.

## 0.2 Proficiency Exams

Typically, many incoming freshmen will already know all of or a large portion of the material for the CS program's introductory courses. To allow students that are coming in with more programming/math experience to move faster through the curriculum, the university offers proficiency exams, which allow students to completely skip a class if they pass the exam. Students will not recieve a letter grade from taking the exam, although they will recieve 

Information on proficiency exams (practice, proctoring, scheduling, minimum passing grades) can be found [here](https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/).

Three different proficiency exams are offered, and an overview of each is provided below:

### 0.2.1 - CS125 Proficiency Exam

This exam is by far the most popular proficiency exam, and many students with varying levels of programming experience take and pass the exam. Students who take this exam typically have taken AP Computer Science A (or have an equivalent level of programming experience) and are motivated to learn additional topics like hashes, trees, big O and linked lists.

### 0.2.2 - CS173 Proficiency Exam

This exam is typically taken by students who have taken a discrete math course in high school or Math+CS/Stats+CS majors who have credit for Calculus 1, 2, and 3 and do not want to take both MATH347 and CS173. This exam covers topics like sets, formal logic, graphs/trees, functions, relations, number theory, induction, and more. Typically the vast majority of incoming freshmen do not have prior discrete math experience, and will not take this proficiency exam.

### 0.2.3 - CS225 Proficiency Exam

An even less common proficiency exam, this exam is targeted towards students who already have an incredibly heavy programming background and know the ins and outs of various data structures like BSTs, stacks, queues, and linked lists.
