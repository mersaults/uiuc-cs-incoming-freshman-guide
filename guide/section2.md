# Section 2 - Registration

To consult how registration generally works, [The Office of the Registrar](https://registrar.illinois.edu/registration/) is an incredibly helpful resource.

## 2.1 - Registration for CS/CS+X majors:
The best resource for figuring out how CS registration works is [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/registration/cs-course-restrictions-enrollment-caps). To boil it down:

* Registration for all CS classes past CS225 is done in a staggered fashion based on year of enrollment, meaning that the classes slowly become available to more people as registration moves on. This also means that priority is determined by when you were actually admitted, your class standing by credit hours. In terms of priority, freshmen < sophomores < juniors < seniors.
* Seats are reserved specfically for transfers and graduate students. If you are a transfer, don't worry about the staggered enrollment, because you will have a spot in the classes you need to graduate.
* For CS4-- electives, CSENG juniors and seniors receieve priority over Math+CS, Stats+CS, and CS+X. Once juniors and seniors have registered, registration is opened to all remaining CS students. The reason why this is the case is because 400 level CS electives are a graduation requirement for CSENG majors, so they need to take these classes in order to graduate. For the most part, if you are one of the aforementioned non-CSENG majors, you should have no trouble registering for the classes you want to even with this rule in place.

## 2.2 - Registration for Non-majors:
For non-majors, CS courses can be broken into two categories:

#### Open Enrollment:
The classes that are open enrollment are:
* CS125: Intro to Computer Science
* CS173: Discrete Structures
* CS225: Data Structrues

Open enrollment means that CS majors are not given specific priority to take these classes, meaning that everyone registers for these classes at the same time. So, the earlier you register the more easily you'll be able to take these classes. James scholars/Chancellor's scholars/ROTC members should have no issues getting these classes since they have the highest registration priorty out of everyone.

#### Staggered Enrollment:

All CS classes past CS225 not already listed above fall under staggered enrollment. The information in ยง2.1 explains how staggered registration works. If you don't care to read it, just know that all CS majors will register before you do.

## 2.3 - Will I Get the CS Class I Want?

This question has variable responses based on what your major is:

#### CS/Stats+CS/Math+CS/CS+X:

Yes. Everybody in these majors should be able to register for whatever CS classes they want to without issue, schedule permitting. There are very few exceptions:
* If you are a first time freshman, you are restrictred from registering from any 400 level CS electives. This is to prevent freshmen who are way ahead of the game (i.e. have already received credit for CS225) to take up class spots that CSENG upperclassmen need fulfill their CS elective requirement.
* A few classes (specifically CS441: Applied Machine Learning and some of the CS498 electives) are very popular and can fill up even by the time that you are able to register. This is not an issue if you are a junior/senior in CSENG, since you pick CS classes before everyone else is able to.
* If you messed up your registration date and are registering later than you should be, then you might be in trouble. Speak with your advisor to make sure that you can get into the classes that you need to take to graduate.

### PREP/Engineering Undeclared:
Yes. Most of the classes that you will be taking in while you are in these programs will be lower level CS classes that are open registration (meaning that CS majors do not have specific priority). Furthermore, there are sections in these classes specifically for PREP and Engineering Undeclared, meaning that the department has already carved out some spots for you.

### For Non-Majors:
The answer to this question is dependent on what classes you plan on registering for:
* CS101/105: Yes. If you plan on taking these, it's probably because they are required for your major, meaning you should have no issues registering.
* CS125: Most likely, yes. This is an intro class created specifically for freshmen, meaning that unless you get incredibly unlucky and the class is filled by the time you register, you'll be able to take this class.
* CS173/CS225: Depends on your registration priority. These classes tend to fill up very quickly because they are in high demand (specifically CS225, which is the de facto software internship class), meaning that the earlier you can register the more easily you will be able to claim a spot.
* CS233/CS241/CS374/CS421: Typically hard to register for. These classes are the true meat of the CS curriculum, meaning that since CS majors register before you there are a very limited number of spots. This is especially true for CS374 which is typically in especially high demand.
* CS4-- electives: Depends entirely on which elective you take. CS majors get spots for these before everyone else, meaning that non-majors typically have a hard time registering for these. That said, some elective courses are not in very high demand, so you are best able to get a spot in one of these.
* Crosslisted CS4-- Electives (e.g. CS413/MATH413): No. All crosslisted 400 level electives are restricted specifically to majors within the departments the class is crosslisted under.
