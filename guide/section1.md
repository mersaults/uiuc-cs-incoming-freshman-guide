# Section 1 - Curriculum Overview

## 1.0.1 - Course Difficulty and What to Expect

If you are at all daunted by how difficult the curriculum might seem, don't be. 

The classes in the CS department are never designed to make you fail. Indeed, the general consensus among CS majors and those who have taken CS classes is that classes are more time consuming than inherently difficult, and generally speaking, both students and faculty are incredibly helpful and want to make sure you succeed.

In terms of how that information becomes relevant to you, recognize that you will not be able to load 7 different CS and math courses into your schedule and still keep your head above water during the semester. Above everything, it is important to pace yourself and not overestimate how much you can take.

## 1.1 - Required Courses:
The current sequence of required CS courses for CSENG, Math+CS, Stats+CS, and CS+X is:

* **CS125: Intro to Computer Science** - A required introductory programming course similar to AP Computer Science A. 
  * Languages: Java
* **CS126: Software Design Studio** - This course is meant to introduce you to good software design patterns and pracitces to prepare you for writing production level code. Also acts as an introduction to C++. 
  * Languages: Java, C++
* **CS173: Discrete Structures** -  A discrete math class designed to introduce you to many mathematical structures and concepts used in computer science, such as graphs/trees, relations, functions, and induction. Introduces proofs and a more rigorous treatment of Big O. Foundational class that is incredibly important for classes like CS374 and CS473.
  * Languages: None, but some use of pseudocode.
* **CS225: Data Structures** - The de facto software internship course. Covers important data structures frequently used in computer science like linked lists, stacks, queues, BSTs, etc. Another incredibly important foundational class.
  * Languages: C++
* **CS233: Computer Architecture** - Effectively the CS majors's ECE course. A very low level overview of how a computer actually works, covering digital logic and implementation of software using circuits and machine code.
  * Languages: Verilog (a hardware description language) QtSpim (a processor simulator)
* **CS241: System Programming** - A very time consuming class that covers a ton of low level programming conceps that are crucial to understanding things like memory management, computer security, system I/O, and concurency. Crucial class for anyone interested in operating system design, embedded/distributed systems, or computer security.
  * Languages: C
* **CS240: Introduction to Computer Systems (NOTE: Required only for select CS+X majors)** - Effectively a merger of CS241 and CS233 designed for CS+X majors who don't want to take both.
  * Languages: C
* **CS357: Numerical Methods (NOTE: Required only for CSENG, Math+CS, and STATS+CS)** - A hybrid math/programming course that covers various applications of computer science to linear algebra and multivariable calculus.
  * Languages: Python
* **CS374: Introduction to Algorithms and Models of Computation** - Covers major elements of algorithm design and analysis. Secondarily covers the mathematical conception of computation through the use of finite state automata and Turing machines.
  * Languages: None, but some pseudocode.
* **CS421: Programming Languages and Compilers** - Fairly self explanatory. Covers elements of programming languages like type systems and functional vs. object-oriented paradigms, and covers how a compiler works.
  * Languages: OCaml, but some sections in the past have been taught in Haskell
